Let's break down its key aspects and how you can build upon it:\\\\n\\\\n**1. FastAPI Foundation:**\\\\n   - The template leverages FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. This means you can easily create efficient endpoints to handle summarization requests.\\\\n\\\\n**2. Function Structure:**\\\\n   - The template predefines functions dedicated to specific summarization tasks. This modularity enhances code organization and maintainability.\\\\n\\\\n**3. Placeholder Logic (Pass Statements):** \\\\n   -  Currently, each function uses a `pass` statement, indicating no actual summarization logic is implemented. This is where you'll integrate your chosen AI or NLP techniques.\\\\n\\\\n**4. Docstrings for Clarity:**\\\\n   -  Each function includes a docstring explaining its intended purpose. These docstrings are crucial for documentation and understanding the codebase.\\\\n\\\\n**5. Tag Propriety Check:**\\\\n   -  The mention of a \\\\\\\"tag propriety check\\\\\\\" suggests a mechanism to validate or categorize input text, potentially to guide the summarization process. \\\\n\\\\n**Expanding with AI Integration:**\\\\n\\\\n   -  **Choose Your Approach:** Select an AI/NLP method for summarization (e.g., extractive, abstractive). Libraries like Transformers (with pre-trained models like BART, T5) are excellent choices.\\\\n   -  **Implement Logic:**  Within each function, replace the `pass` statement with the code to:\\\\n      -  Receive input text\\\\n      -  Preprocess if needed (e.g., text cleaning, tokenization)\\\\n      -  Apply your chosen summarization model \\\\n      -  Post-process the summary (e.g., formatting)\\\\n      -  Return the generated summary\\\\n\\\\n**Example (Using Transformers):**\\\\n\\\\n\"\n",
